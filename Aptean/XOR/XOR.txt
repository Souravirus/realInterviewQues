You are given an array of size 10^8. The i^th element in the array is the XOR of natural numbers from 1 to i. You have Q  operations to perform and in each opertion, you are given 2 integers L and R.
Write a program to find the sum of the elements in the range [L....R].

Input format
The first line consists of an integer Q. 
Then Q lines follow where each line has 2 integers L and R.

Output format

For each operation, print in a new line the sum from L to R.

Constraints:
1 <= Q <= 10^8
1 <= L <= R <= 10^8

Sample Input
2
1 3
2 5

Sample Output
4
8

Explanation:
First 5 elements of the array are 1, 3, 0, 4, 1
Sum from 1 to 3 is 4 ad sum from 2 to 5 is 8.
