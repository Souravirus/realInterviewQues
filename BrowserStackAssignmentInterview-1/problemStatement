You have to implement a simple stateless web service that allows one to interact with two web-browsers: Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

The service should support the following endpoints:

GET /start browser, url Starts <browser> which has the <url> open inside it.
GET /stop browser Kills the <browser>.
GET /cleanup browser Deletes all the browsing session information such as history, cache, cookies, downloads, saved passwords, etc for <browser>
GET /geturl browser Returns the current active tab's URL. Assume the <browser> has exactly one window and multiple tabs.
<browser> = chrome/firefox

<url> = Any valid URL like: http://www.browserstack.com

Example usage of endpoints:

http://<server>/start?browser=<browser>&url=<url> should start the desired browser and open the URL in the same browser instance.
http://<server>/geturl?browser=<browser> should get the current active tab URL for the given browser
http://<server>/stop?browser=<browser> should stop the given browser if it is running
http://<server>/cleanup?browser=<browser> should clean up the browsing session for the given browser if has been stopped.
Points to note:

Browsers have to be started/stopped on the server's end. i.e. if the server is running on machine A and a request to /start is made from machine B, the browser should start on machine A. For purpose of this assignment, assume machine A and B to be the same, i.e. your own machine.
Any tool or library that relies on the Selenium (WebDriver) protocol should not be a dependency of the service.
Service does not need to be OS independent, i.e. if you have a Windows machine, it is expected that the service runs properly in Windows but it is not expected that it runs properly across all operating systems. That said, if you provide an OS independent implementation, you will get bonus points.
Remember to take backup before hitting /cleanup in order to avoid erasure of your data.
