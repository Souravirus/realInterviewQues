Given a map of n citiesin which some cities are connected by m undirected roads in total. 
A map trip between city u and city v is valid only if u and v are connected by means of some roads. You have been given q queries. Each query contains  integers (u, v).
For each query, you need to check if there is a valid path between u and v. Return the total number of queries where there is a valid path between u and v. 

Constraints: 
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 10^5)
1 <= q <= 10^5
1 <= u, v <= n
u != v

Input:
Arg1: Integer n denoting the number of cities.
Arg2: 2D matrix B. Every row in B has exactly 2 integer elements u and v, denoting a road between u and v,
Arg3: 2d matrix C. Every row in C has exactly 2 integer elements u and v, denoting a query (u, v)

Example:
n = 4

Matrix R:
1 3
4 3

Queries Q:
3 2
1 4
2 4

Return: 1

Explanation: Only query 2 has a valid path between 1 and 4. For rest of the queries, there is no valid path between given cities.
